To-do
-----

* Web server to serve static files
    * http://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/HTTP/servers/how-to-serve-static-files
    * mime types from file extensions
    * write a PID file
* Use Host: header to serve multiple sites
* Split formatting (HTML/CSS) from content
    * static generation of web pages a la Jekyll
    * code we can re-use in a dynamic context as well
    * multiple-language content
* Language for input forms
    * data storage (files? SQLite?)
    * output rendering of stored data

Principles
----------

* Two basic sources of data:
    * From developers (including non-dev staff): can go in Git
    * From users of site (needs to go in to locally updated storage, generally)
    * Think of a blog: entries from developers, comments from wide world
* Content vs. formatting
    * content might be in multiple languages, but uses same formatting
* Multi-language
